This demonstrates using a web framework. When your applications start getting more and more complex it becomes necessary to use a web framework that helps with tasks such as builiding modular components, providing reactive UI elements, supporting sessions, lazy loading, and reducing the size of your application.

Some frameworks take the additional step of abstracting parts of HTML and CSS to make authoring components easier. When this happens the project must be pre-processed in order to turn it into HTML and CSS that the browser can execute. This process requires a tool chain that executes to produce a browser ready bundle.

For this project we will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework and the associated React CLI.
